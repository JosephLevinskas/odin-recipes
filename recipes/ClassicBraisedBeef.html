                <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then sear it on all sides until browned. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot and sauté until softened.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the beef broth and red wine (if using), scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add the carrots, celery, thyme, and bay leaf. Return the beef to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Braise for about 3 hours, or until the beef is tender and easily shredded with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Remove the beef from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing or shredding. Discard the bay leaf and thyme sprigs from the pot.</li>
                    <li>Serve the braised beef with the vegetables and pan juices spooned over the top.</li>
                </ol>
